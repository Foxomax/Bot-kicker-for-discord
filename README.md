# HYMLOOVER-BOT

Hello everyone, my name is *Foxomax*, the beloved Foxo. Today I bring you this script for a discord bot that kicks spammers.
It is completely open source, so you are free to add things and improve it, it simply kicks the bots if it detects their messages as indecent.
They can improve and add algorithms to relate to this type of bots, and if they want to implement it and make bans for life, they can make the changes.

Remember that if you implement it, thank the creator.

## How to use it ?

The first thing will be to go to <a href="https://discord.com/developers/applications">discord</a> and create a new application, then generate a token and create a permanent or temporary environment variable (according to your taste) to save the token safely, remember not to share it. After that, invite the bot to a test server and test it,and then we return to discord developer and go to the OAuth section and we will see a list, we will select the one that says 'bot' and then we go down and give the permissions for [Kick,Ban] or whatever you need, after that, you copy the lik that is generated in OAuth and that will be your invitation card for the bot to join the server.

As you will see, the bot will appear disconnected, we will turn it on by pasting the token we took to the environment variable you want, then all we need to do is run the script and wow! The bot now works...
